# Python Class
These are short programs that I wrote in an introductory two-day Python class at the Tech Academy in Portland, OR.

1. Addition with Input - This takes two input numbers and adds them together, unless they are too large, in which case they get a snarky reply.  Practicing if/else statements.

2. Lottery Age Check - This greets the user by an input name, then ensures they are 18 or older. If they are less than 18, they are told how many years until they can return. Practicing if/else, input, defining functions.

3. Store Program - This allows a user to add items to a shopping cart and purchase them.  Practicing loops, string functions, exponents.
